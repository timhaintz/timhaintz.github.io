G'Day. This Blog has been created to share useful automation scripts and tips, primarily using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting?view=powershell-6). It includes other tools leveraging PowerShell such as [PowerCLI](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/) from VMware and [PowerTool Suite](https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-37154) from Cisco.

I work daily with Infrastructure as Code, DevOps, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and cloud technologies, primarily Azure. These technologies will also feature here.

[Azure Automated Test Environment](https://github.com/timhaintz/aate) is an Open Source project I created to allow everyone to experiment with Azure. It builds a Windows Server Core Domain Controller and a Windows Server GUI Certificate Authority in a Resource Group with networking and storage setup. AATE uses Azure Resource Manager, ARM templates, PowerShell, Azure Automation and Desired State Configuration to automatically build the environment.

This blog was created using GitHub Pages and Jekyll as it enables me to use my existing version control workflows. I use version control and GitHub daily so this was a natural fit for me. As part of setting this blog up, I'm learning about Jekyll and CSS which has been rewarding. Initial site setup was done using [Jonathan McGlone's guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Thanks to Jonathan for the guide.
