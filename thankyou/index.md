# Thank You

Thank you to the people and products below. Without their creativity and knowledge sharing, this blog would not have been created. A quote that I often remind myself is ["Standing on the shoulders of giants"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). This sums up my appreciation for the assistance provided from those below.
