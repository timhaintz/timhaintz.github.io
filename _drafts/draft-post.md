## Introduction

The last time I sat an IT certification exam was in 2006. I sat for my CCNA. I had failed the exam twice before and thankfully, it was third time lucky for me. I sat my first IT Certification exam in 2002, passing the Windows 2000 Professional exam. I have continually honed my craft, learned and gained knowledge, I've just not sat an exam to certifiy. A driving philosophy of mine is Kaizen, or, in my words, getting a little bit better each day.

Why take an exam now?

A collegue of mine recently sat a certification exam and it inspired me to do the same. I started working in IT in 2001 and completed my Bachelor of Computing degree in 2003. I have 18+ years working in IT and watched as the paper MCSEs flooded the market in the early 2000s. It left a bad taste in my mouth around certifications. The new exams sound much more 'useful' than the TestKing cram exams of the past.
