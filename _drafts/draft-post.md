Below is an overview of the *Secure your cloud data* module. It is in dot point form and a raw dump of information as I progressed through the course.
The modules I'm going to complete are displayed in [Learning path for Azure Administrator](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWtY7Z)

The second module in the Learning path for Azure Administrator I am going to work through is [Secure your cloud data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/secure-your-cloud-data/index).

[Design for security in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/design-for-security-in-azure/index)



Hope you're having a great day and this is of use.

Thanks, Tim.
