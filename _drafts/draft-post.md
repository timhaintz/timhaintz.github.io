## Introduction

The last time I sat an IT certification exam was in 2006. I sat for my CCNA. I had failed the exam twice before and thankfully, it was third time lucky for me. I sat my first IT Certification exam in 2002, passing the Windows 2000 Professional exam. Since then, I have continually honed my craft, learned and gained knowledge, I've just not sat an exam to certifiy.
