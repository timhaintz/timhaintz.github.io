The first series of online training is [Cloud Concepts - Principals of cloud computing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/principles-cloud-computing/index). This is a fundemental overview of Azure. It is used as base knowledge for future concepts.

The second series of online training is [Core Cloud Services - Introduction to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/index). This is more hands on and allows you to create a virtual machine using [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

Thanks, Tim.
