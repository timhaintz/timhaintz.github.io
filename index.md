# Tim's Automation & Scripting Blog

G'Day. This Blog has been created to share useful automation scripts and tips, primarily using [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-scripting?view=powershell-6). It also includes other tools leveraging PowerShell such as [PowerCLI](https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/PowerCLI/) from VMware and [PowerTool Suite](https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-37154) from Cisco.

I'm also interested in Infrastructure as Code, DevOps, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and cloud technologies. These technologies will also feature here.

I'm currently learning Python using [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) written by Al Sweigart. Once I become more familiar with Python, I will add some examples to this site.
